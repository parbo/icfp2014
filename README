How we did it:

Looking at the GCC instruction set, it looked like it was geared towards lisp.
Some googling found it to be very similar to a SECD machine. So we created a
lisp compiler for it. The lisp dialect is a bit quirky, but it'll do.

In this lisp, we wrote the lambdaman ai. Fun fact: uses the same PRNG as ZX Spectrum.

We also wrote some utils to able to write ghost ai using labels instead of raw
addresses, and some utilities for debugging/testing ghosts locally.
